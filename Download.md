## Tilda Downloads

Latest Version: [v0.9.41](https://www.mediafire.com/file/84e4aarndtt7p29/Tilda_Setup.zip/file)

### Latest Version Important Notes
- Tilda's default Active scan keybind is "`" (or "~"), the key located above the "Tab" button, you may need to unbind the console from this key in the EFT settings OR change the keybind for the Active scan in Tilda.
- Tilda has Auto-Inspect enabled by default when first installing. This allows for a faster adn easier time when scanning items, but be wary that if the scan key/keybind is hit while not in menu, it can cause you to shoot your gun in game as it triggers a double-click of your mouse to inspect items.

### Known Bugs (This is still in beta, please be patient, I am working on fixing these)
- Window opacity adjustments in the settings menu are currently disabled due to them causing issues when applying
- In-Menu hotkey/keybind editor is bugged, and has been disabled. Keybinds can stil be changed by editing the 'settings.ini' file located at 'C:\dotdot\Tilda\settings.ini'
- Allow text highlighting and toggle event listener toggles are disabled temporarily
- Sometimes when booting Tilda, the loading window fails to properly initiate and exits without errors. This can be fixed by simply relaunching Tilda. Tilda will not crash afterwards.
