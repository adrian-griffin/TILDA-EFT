## Tilda Downloads

Latest Version: [v0.9.41](https://www.mediafire.com/file/84e4aarndtt7p29/Tilda_Setup.zip/file)

### Known Bugs (This is still in beta, please be patient, I am working on fixing these)
- Window opacity adjustments in the settings menu are currently disabled due to them causing issues when applying
- In-Menu hotkey/keybind editor is bugged, and has been disabled. Keybinds can stil be changed by editing the 'settings.ini' file located at 'C:\dotdot\Tilda\settings.ini'
- Allow text highlighting and toggle event listener toggles are disabled temporarily
- Sometimes when booting Tilda, the loading window fails to properly initiate and exits without errors. This can be fixed by simply relaunching Tilda. Tilda will not crash afterwards.
