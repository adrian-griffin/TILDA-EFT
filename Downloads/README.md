# Download Tilda
### NOTE: If you play Tarkov in English and do not plan on changing the default installation directory of Tilda when installing, simply download the "All-In-One" archive from the link and run the setup application. 
#### Otherwise, if you plan on using a language other than English, or plan on installing Tilda into a different directory than the default, please download the "Tilda + Tesseract Package". More info about the installation of Tilda and Tesseract individually can be found on the "OCR" page in this repository. 

### Tilda can only run on Windows machines, as I didn't put in the effort of porting the application to Linux or MacOS as EFT cannot run on either.
#### If you are somehow managing to run EFT on Linux, hmu lol
