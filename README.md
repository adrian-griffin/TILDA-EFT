# Tilda - A Fast and Reliable Escape From Tarkov Item Scanner
A heavily customizable, lightweight, and quick scanner that helps you easily get useful information about items in Escape From Tarkov while in game.
Gone are the days of having your friend (or yourself) look up that 22 inch barrel that you aren't sure whether is worth 4k or 120k on the flea market.
Gone are the days of trying to remember which color of MOE AKM grip is needed for a quest down the line.

Tilda will automatically scan the item you select and within less than a second, return any usefull information you would need at a moment's notice, from the average Flea Market price of said item, to the trader it is best to sell to (and the price it sells to them), price per slot based off of the highest price you can sell for, and even how many quests the item is used in.

## How It Works:
Tilda has two scan options currently available, though the scan method differs heavily between the two, both use simple screenshots of the EFT application to gather information about the item you are scanning. This does *NOT* in *ANY* way access the game memory or use any other method of information gathering in the same vein, therefore, it hardly can be considered "cheating". Tilda just grabs the information you can already look up about any item for you, and displays it all in one place within seconds.

### Scan Type 1 (Active/Primary Scan)
The first scan method (referred to as the Active or Primary scan), uses
