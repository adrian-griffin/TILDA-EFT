## Tilda ~~ A Fast and Reliable Escape From Tarkov Item Scanner
Tilda is a heavily customizable, lightweight, and quick scanner that helps you easily get useful information about items in Escape From Tarkov while in game.

Gone are the days of having your friend (or yourself) look up that 22 inch barrel that you aren't sure whether is worth 4K or 120K on the flea market.

Need to know whether an item you found in raid is used in any quests? Or whether that blue electric drill is still worth at least 10K per slot?

Tilda will automatically scan the item you select, and within less than a second it will return any usefull information you would need at a moment's notice, from the average Flea Market price of said item, to the trader it is best sold to (and the price it sells to them), the price per slot based off of the highest price you can sell for, how many quests the item is used in, and even a quick link to the Tarkov Wiki with the click of a button!

All images and showcases of Tilda in action are below.

**ALL** code for the project is open source, using ML and computer vision written entirely in Python and C, making the application very quick and incredibly fast at scanning.

## How It Works:
Tilda has two scan options currently available, though the scan method differs heavily between the two, both use simple screenshots of the EFT application to gather information about the item you are scanning. This does *NOT* in *ANY* way access the game memory or use any other method of information gathering in the same vein, therefore, it hardly can be considered "cheating". Tilda just grabs the information you can already look up about any item for you, and displays it all in one place within seconds.

The first scan method (referred to as the Active or Primary scan), uses
