### IMPORTANT: If you installed (or plan to install) Tilda in the default location, make sure you enter this exact path into the Tesseract installer. If you need to have the Tesseract install in another location, or you changed the install location of Tilda from the default, you will NEED to edit the settings file within the Tilda install directory to reflect the Tesseract install path!!
